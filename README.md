# Example GraphQL project with Axum

This is a simple example GraphQL project I made to learn the basics of GraphQL, perhaps you will find this useful.

This project is modelled against Traversy Media's excellent ["Building a GraphQL Server" videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEcJxkylcRM&list=PLillGF-RfqbYZty73_PHBqKRDnv7ikh68), without the `json_server` part.
